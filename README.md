# Task List Application

This is a simple tutorial project. It creates a task list application using Laravel. It uses Blade for the user interface.

For the sake of credit, the tutorial can be found on Udemy at this location:<br>

The tutorial has several projects. This is the first one.

## Secon Run
This is my second run through the project. This time I will add a few of my own fields and features. Also, I'm going to add another challenge. The tutorial uses Laravel 10 but I'm going to use Laravel 11. I'll have to figure out how to accomplish the tasks set out in the tutorial using the newer framework.


### GitHub Workflow
Most importantly, this time I'm creating a GitHub workflow where I have created the GitHub repository first, then cloned the (empty) repository to a local repository. Now I'm going to create branches as I move through the tutorial. 

### Branch Merges
I'm also going to merge branches using GitHub's "Pull Request" feature rathere than Git's "merge" feature. I've never done that before and I need the experience.
